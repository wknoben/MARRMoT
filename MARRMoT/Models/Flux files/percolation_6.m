% Description:  Threshold-based percolation from a store that can reach negative values
% Constraints:  f <= S/dt
% @(Inputs):    p1   - maximum percolation rate
%               p2   - storage threshold for reduced percolation [mm]
%               S    - current storage [mm]
%               dt   - time step size [d]

out = min(max(0,S)/dt,p1.*min(1,max(0,S)./p2));
